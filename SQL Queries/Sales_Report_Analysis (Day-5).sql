-- -------------------------------------------------- Advanced Logic for Report Automation -----------------------------------------------------------

-- Query-10) Create a query that produces a report-ready table with: (department name, employee name, total revenue, 
-- total cost, rank within department, performance flag ("Above Avg" or "Below Avg")

-- Query-11) Find all employees who had no sales in the first half of 2023 but had at least one sale in the second half.

-- Query-12) Create a view that shows monthly aggregated metrics (revenue, cost, ratio) for all departments.

-- Query-13) Find employees whose sales values have increased in every consecutive quarter of 2023.

-- Query-14) Write a query that identifies and removes duplicate sales records based on employee ID and sale date, keeping only the one with the highest revenue.
